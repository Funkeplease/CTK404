<h2> Oluwafunke Ademola-Aliu </h2>
   <p> Dear Funke, listen to me! I have carried you since you left your mother’s womb. I carried you when you were born, and I will still be carrying you when you’re old. Your hair will turn gray, and I will still carry you. I made you, and I will carry you to safety. Love, God </p>
